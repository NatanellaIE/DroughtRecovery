# DroughtRecovery
Here you will find the code we used for both bulk and single cell RNA-seq analysis in our publication: XXX
Attached are: code for bulk datasets, and bulk counts files for:
Run1 = Bulk RNA-seq vermaculite grown fine-scale time-course of drought and recovery (9 time-points)
Run2 = Bulk RNA-seq plate grown moderate stress and recovery - up to 4 hours
Run3 = Bulk RNA-seq plate grown severe stress and recovery - up to 90 minutes. The code for single cell data, Arabidopsis TF list, and a master marker list for marker genes collected from the literature, that can be used for cluster annotation.
